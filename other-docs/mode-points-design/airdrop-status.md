# ðŸª™ Airdrop Status

The airdrop point system has been architected to acknowledge and reward early participants in the Mode ecosystem. These points encapsulate a range of activities, including assets on Mode, interacting with applications within the ecosystem, historical engagement across other blockchain networks, and more. Points calculated directly mirror the magnitude of your contributions, not just the quantity.

The points mechanism is currently live and producing updated points on a weekly basis. You can check our community for the latest updates and announcements about this. While the campaign runs, we will be balancing the weights on a regular basis, and keep adding metrics to reward the right behavior.

To add to transparency, we maintain a running list of our metrics and the current status. Our calculations are directly related to onchain activity, so even if a metric is still pending, points for actions today will be added as soon as our system is updated, and the outcome has been tested.
