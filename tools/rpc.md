{% hint style="success" %}
If your project needs better performance you can try running your own node. Check all the information here: [node-operators.md](node-operators.md "mention")

## Public RPC (Archival node)

Our public RPC is a full archive node and should be enough for most use cases:\
RPC Endpoint: [https://mainnet.mode.network/](https://mainnet.mode.network/)

## Blast API - Decentralized Web3 Infra - (Archival node)

Solving Web3 reliability and performance issues by efficiently employing the resources of hundreds of third party node providers combined with a state-of-the-art decentralized blockchain API platform and an improved user experience.\

RPC Endpoint: [https://blastapi.io/chains/mode](https://blastapi.io/chains/mode)

## 1RPC

Automata now supports Mode mainnet via their 1RPC, this introduces an extra layer of security by protecting some metadata from being shared to interact with RPCs in a more private way. You can learn more about 1RPC [here](https://docs.1rpc.io/overview/about-1rpc).

RPC Endpoint: [https://1rpc.io/mode](https://1rpc.io/mode)

## dRPC

dRPC is decentralised RPC network that enhances security, reliability, and cost-efficiency for Web3 companies of all sizes. We are building the most reliable and cost-efficient Data providing solution via a decentralized platform. Learn more about dRPC [here](https://drpc.org/chainlist/mode).
